rf-protocols-java
=================

Project aimed to create parsers/analysers/senders of popular RF (433.92 MHz) protocols such as Oregon Weather, Lacrosse, Owl, Ambient, PT2262, etc <br/>
Should work on single-board computers supporting Java (like Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Cubieboard, etc) <br/>
Has adapters for receiving low-level RF data from GPIO pins for popular libraries such as <a href="http://pi4j.com/">Pi4J</a> and <a href="http://libbulldog.org/bulldog/">libbulldog</a> <br/>
Also USB dongle on RTL2832 could be used for receiving RF signals (<a href="https://code.google.com/p/sdrtrunk/">SDRTrunk</a> is used) <br/>

Library has simple <a href="https://github.com/eschava/rf-protocols-java/wiki/MQTT-client">MQTT client</a> implemented
